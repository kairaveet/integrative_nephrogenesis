"Bridging the gap of late-gestation nephrogenesis using a non-human primate model"

## ðŸ“– Overview
Late-gestation nephrogenesis is a critical period during kidney development, responsible for generating the majority of nephrons. While human nephrogenesis transitions through distinct phasesâ€”including branching phase nephrogenesis (BpN) and lateral branch nephrogenesis (LBN)â€”the molecular mechanisms underlying these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we leveraged scRNA-seq to integrate rhesus macaque and human fetal kidney datasets, providing insights into the transitional nephron progenitor cell (NPC) states that may regulate nephron amplification during LBN.

## ðŸ“Š Data Availability
The single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in this study will be available on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number [GEO Accession Number] (to be released upon publication).

Publicly available human fetal kidney datasets used for integration are: GSE114530, GSE112570, and GSE102596.
